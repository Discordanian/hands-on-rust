Flappy is chapter 3 of the hands on rust book.

# OSX
seems to work fine


# WSL
Internet suggested some changes including trying 
MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3 MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=330 cargo run
https://issueexplorer.com/issue/amethyst/bracket-lib/243


which didn't work.

I also installed openGL drivers.

Still no luck.  Getting a panic.  Will continue this on the mac.

On page 53.
